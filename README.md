# This end-to-end analytics project investigates worldwide layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic by combining SQL-based data cleaning and exploratory analysis with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

**The data was intially cleaned using both basic and more advanced SQL concepts such as Joins, Aggeregate functions, CTEs and Window functions.**

**The project then moved onto some EDA, once again using CTEs to calculate rolling totals as well as group by and order by for some quick insights on the most affected industries and countries**

**To communicate these findings in a way which would be accessible for all, the data was then exported into PowerBI to create interative dashboards. Similar to what was done using SQL, a DAX was used to create a rolling total to showcase the progressive nature of job layoffs since the pandemic.**

**Screenshots from the PowerBI dashboards created can be found above**
